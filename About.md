# Why Kopal? #

  1. If you use your own website to publish your blog and pictures, now you can also have your social profile on your own website with Kopal. Everything that makes you, now at one place.
  1. Since the data is stored on your own servers, it is you who owns the data.
  1. You can modify your profile up to your heart's content. Edit right into database, add widgets, change the layout of profile; it's after all you who owns your profile data.
  1. Unlike present social-networking services, Kopal is not isolated. i.e., if two social-networking services understand [Kopal protocol](Kopal_Connect.md), profiles from both websites can interact with each other and can exchange social-information.
  1. If a website (not necessarily social-networking service) understands [Kopal protocol](Kopal_Connect.md), it can leverage the social-information of its users.
  1. Kopal is an open-standard and patent-free with an open-source reference implementation. <a href='Hidden comment: Which means...'></a>
  1. ![http://openid.net/favicon.ico?image.png](http://openid.net/favicon.ico?image.png) [OpenID](http://openid.net) is at the core of Kopal. A Kopal Identity automatically gives you all goodies of OpenID.
  1. Since OpenID is integrated into core of Kopal, anyone with an OpenID can interact with a Kopal profile (limited however).
  1. [Kopal](Kopal_Feed.md) makes your social-information more semantic. Your social data is represented using microformats that makes it easy for machines to understand it.
  1. Reference implementation of Kopal has "Multiple profile" feature built-in. If you belong to a group or organisation, you can have a Kopal profile for everyone in your group from a single installation of Kopal.
  1. Hundreds of social-networking websites are launched everyday. We want to be the _de-facto_ standard for social-networking such that these websites can leverage the benefits of "distributed social networking" and plug-in <a href='Hidden comment: ad-hoc better word? As in ad-hoc wireless network.'></a> themselves in an already existing network rather than dying in isolation.


# Why not Kopal!? #

  1. At present, managing authentication of user across the network is [PITA](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pain_in_the_arse). However it is expected to change with innovative ideas and some clever implementation of it. (See [Challenges](Challenge.md)).
  1. At present, there are very few Kopal enabled social-profile across web. But that is just a matter of time.
  1. Kopal is in its beginning and is highly experimental and may not be suitable for production environment.
  1. The reference implementation of Kopal is (for now) available only in [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org). However since Kopal is an open-standard, it is expected to be supported on multiple platforms by community.
  1. For now to get a Kopal profile, you need have a website and server space. However this will change with the launch of [Kryzen](http://www.kryzen.net) service which will provide free Kopal profiles.
